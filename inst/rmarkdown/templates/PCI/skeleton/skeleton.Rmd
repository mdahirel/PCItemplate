<!--to do: set it so figures and tables are blocked on the right side and if too large expand on the left side of the writing column-->

# Introduction {-}

This is an example of text. Note the use of {-} in headers in the code to suppress automatic header numbering. Do not forget it when you add your own custom headers and subheaders!

This realization is especially important because it can flip around our expectations about which species expand fast, and how to manage them. We tend to think of initial colonization and long-term abundance as two independent axes of variation among species or indeed as two ends of a spectrum, in the classic competition-colonization tradeoff [@levins1971regional]. When both play into invasion speed, good dispersers might not outrun good competitors. This is useful knowledge, whether we want to contain an invasion or secure a reintroduction.

In their study "When higher carrying capacities lead to faster propagation", @preprint combine mathematical analysis, Individual-Based simulations and experiments to show that various mechanisms can cause pushed fronts, whose speed increases with the carrying capacity K of the species. Rather than focus on one particular angle, the authors endeavor to demonstrate that this qualitative effect appears again and again in a variety of settings.

# Methods {-}

This is filler text. It is perhaps surprising that this notable and general connection between K and invasion speed has managed to garner so little fame in ecology. A large fraction of the literature employs the venerable Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which combines local logistic growth with linear diffusion in space. This model has prompted both considerable mathematical developments [@crooks2004spatial] and many applications to modelling real invasions [@shigesada1997biological]. But it only allows pulled fronts, driven by the small populations at the edge of a species range, with a speed that depends only on their initial growth rate r.

## Statistical analyses {-}

Markdown documents can use LaTeX syntax to display equations, either inline: $y_{i} = x$, or as their own equation block:

$$y_{i} = x$$

# Results {-}

```{r fig1, fig.cap="A good figure", out.width="10cm"}
x <- 1:10
y <- 11:20
plot(x, y)
```

This is your Results part. Results are sometimes displayed in tables. Tables can be included in several ways. Either directly in the text using (Pandoc) Markdown syntax, as in Table 1. We can also make tables in RMarkdown, using packages such as `kable` and extensions, as in Table 2.

| First Header  | Second Header | Third Header         |
| :------------ | :-----------: | -------------------: |
| First row     | Data          | Very long data entry |
| Second row    |               | *Cell*               |
| Third row     | **cell**      | the last data        | 

Table: This is a table


In both cases, note in the code where the caption is, and that tables are automatically numbered in the order of their introduction (in the `kable` table, independently of the chunk label). In Table 1, see one example of how cells can be left empty. 

```{r table-kable}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), caption= "This is also a table", format="latex")
#the format="latex" is important if you want to cross-reference the table
#using the \@ref(tab:...) syntax
#can be omitted otherwise. Try things!
```


One can also easily add figures, either directly generated with code in-file (like Fig. 1), or imported (like Figs.2-3). There are several ways to import figures in RMarkdown; the preferred way in this template is to use `include_figures()` within a chunk. This makes in particular figure scaling much easier, and allows you to import pdf files as figures.

Figures will place themselves in order of their introduction in the code, but where there is room, so not necessarily where you placed them *relative to text*. Play with structure to obtain the effect you want.


```{r fig2, fig.cap="A great figure", out.width="5cm"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig.pdf")
```


```{r fig3, out.width="10cm", fig.cap="The best figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig.png")
```

# Discussion {-}

Some filler text again. It is perhaps surprising that this notable and general connection between K and invasion speed has managed to garner so little fame in ecology. A large fraction of the literature employs the venerable Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which combines local logistic growth with linear diffusion in space. This model has prompted both considerable mathematical developments [@crooks2004spatial] and many applications to modelling real invasions [@shigesada1997biological].
