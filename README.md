# RMarkdown template for preprint recommended by one of the Peer Communities In

written by Maxime Dahirel (GitHub: [@mdahirel](https://github.com/mdahirel)), from original LaTeX templates

# To use this template

- open the `manuscript.Rmd` file
- modify the YAML header (all the lines until the second `---`) with your informations (including your bibliography file path)
- write your preprint in the body of the document
- press `Knit` or use `render()`
- *Voila!*

This RMarkdown template is based on the LaTeX templates available here https://peercommunityin.org/templates/, with modifications to allow you to fill all metadata fields directly from the YAML header of the `Rmd` file. 

This template relies on the `bookdown` package. It is possible to output without it, but some functions are lost. See the "DO NOT CHANGE these settings unless you know what you're doing" block of the YAML header.

If you need any help in how to write your RMarkdown document, the RMarkdown Cookbook by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, Emily Riederer (https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) is a good start, but many resources are available online.

NB: please ensure there is *no* reference with the key 'recommendedpreprint' in your bibliography files. This key will be used by the LaTeX templates to build and display the "cite as" paragraph on the first page of the pdf.

**Important note regarding references lists:** In some cases, some unwanted annotation fields can appear in the reference lists. While we work on ironing these out, the best solution may be to delete manually the unwanted fields from the .bib file. For Zotero users, use Better BibTeX and export bibliographies as Better BibLaTeX to reduce these problems (preferentially with automatic title capitalization turned off, see Advanced> Export in Better BibTex preference panel).

# PS: how to add new PCIs to the template

PCIs all have the exact same template, with the exception of the name (obviously) and the header images. This makes adding a new PCI to the template very straightforward:

- start by coining a short name for the PCI (e.g. "Evolutionary Biology" -> "evolbiol")
- add this name to the list at the top of the `manuscript.Rmd` file, so that authors can find it
- add both the first page header image and the secondary header image to the `resources` folder, with filenames `logo_pour_PDF_PCIshortname.png` and `small_logo_pour_PDF_PCIshortname.png` respectively, where `PCIshortname` is of course, your PCI short code name
- in the `templates\preamble.tex` file, starting line â‰ˆ 156, there is a series of nested if statements on how to expand a short code into the PCI long name. Add yours to the list
- you're ready to write fully formatted articles for the new PCI!
