# Introduction {-}

This is an example of text. Note the use of {-} in headers in the code to suppress automatic header numbering. Do not forget it when you add your own custom headers and subheaders!

This realization is especially important because it can flip around our expectations about which species expand fast, and how to manage them. We tend to think of initial colonization and long-term abundance as two independent axes of variation among species or indeed as two ends of a spectrum, in the classic competition-colonization tradeoff [@levins1971regional]. When both play into invasion speed, good dispersers might not outrun good competitors. This is useful knowledge, whether we want to contain an invasion or secure a reintroduction.

In their study "When higher carrying capacities lead to faster propagation", @preprint combine mathematical analysis, Individual-Based simulations and experiments to show that various mechanisms can cause pushed fronts, whose speed increases with the carrying capacity K of the species. Rather than focus on one particular angle, the authors endeavor to demonstrate that this qualitative effect appears again and again in a variety of settings.

# Methods {-}

This is filler text. It is perhaps surprising that this notable and general connection between K and invasion speed has managed to garner so little fame in ecology. A large fraction of the literature employs the venerable Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which combines local logistic growth with linear diffusion in space. This model has prompted both considerable mathematical developments [@crooks2004spatial] and many applications to modelling real invasions [@shigesada1997biological]. But it only allows pulled fronts, driven by the small populations at the edge of a species range, with a speed that depends only on their initial growth rate r.

## Statistical analyses {-}

Markdown documents can use LaTeX syntax to display equations, either inline: $y_{i} = x$, or as their own equation block:

$$y_{i} = x$$

# Results {-}

```{r fig1, fig.cap="A good figure", out.width="10cm"}
x <- 1:10
y <- 11:20
plot(x, y)
```

This is your Results part. Results are sometimes displayed in tables. Tables can be included in several ways. **The preferred method for this template** is through the use of the `kable` package and its extensions, like `kableExtra` for restyling. Other methods, like inputting a Markdown table directly in the text, have been known to lead to pagination bugs in some cases, that have not been ironed out yet.

```{r table-kable}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), caption= "This is a table", 
             booktabs = T)
#the format="latex" argument is REQUIRED for proper rendering in final pdf
# but it is set globally at the start of the document,
# so no need to give it in each table
```

Note in the code where the caption is, and that tables are automatically numbered in the order of their introduction (independently of the chunk label).

Tables and figures can be cross-referenced using the `\@ref(a:b)` syntax, where *a* is the object type ("tab" for tables, "fig" for figures, "eqn" for equations) and *b* the label of the corresponding chunk. For instance, see Table \@ref(tab:table-kable).

```{r table-kable2}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 5:8]), caption= "This is also a table, but with vertical lines kept")
```

One can also easily add figures, either directly generated with code in-file (like Fig.\@ref(fig:fig1), or imported (like Figs.\@ref(fig:fig2)-\@ref(fig:fig3)). There are several ways to import figures in RMarkdown; the preferred way in this template is to use `include_figures()` within a chunk. This makes in particular figure scaling much easier, and allows you to import pdf files as figures.

Figures will place themselves in order of their introduction in the code, but where there is room, so not necessarily where you placed them *relative to text*. Play with structure to obtain the effect you want.


```{r fig2, fig.cap="A great figure", out.width="5cm"}
include_graphics("resources/fig.pdf")
```


```{r fig3, out.width="10cm", fig.cap="The best figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/fig.png")
```

# Discussion {-}

Some filler text again. It is perhaps surprising that this notable and general connection between K and invasion speed has managed to garner so little fame in ecology. A large fraction of the literature employs the venerable Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which combines local logistic growth with linear diffusion in space. This model has prompted both considerable mathematical developments [@crooks2004spatial] and many applications to modelling real invasions [@shigesada1997biological].
